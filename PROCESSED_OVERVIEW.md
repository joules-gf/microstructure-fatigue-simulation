## What this project is

This is an automated microstructure fatigue simulation pipeline built around:

1. XML input files describing domain, material phases, and Abaqus settings.
2. MicroStructPy mesh generation.
3. Abaqus `.inp` generation and Abaqus job execution.
4. Abaqus `.odb` force/displacement extraction.
5. Stress-strain/cyclic postprocessing and comparison against ROM/experimental reference curves.

The project README identifies `00_Main_Scripts/full_simulation_runner.py` as the intended main entry point.

## Main pipeline scripts

- `00_Main_Scripts/full_simulation_runner.py`
  - Calls `generate_input(...)`, then `run_simulation(...)`, then `post_processing(...)`.
  - Currently has a hardcoded Windows input folder path.

- `00_Main_Scripts/abaqus_input_generation_v02.py`
  - Current/main version of input generation.
  - Handles XML includes, missing input defaults, cyclic loading waveform creation, MicroStructPy execution, `.inp` copying, and Abaqus input file completion.
  - Largest project file: 843 total lines, about 574 code-ish lines.

- `00_Main_Scripts/run_abaqus_sim.py`
  - Changes into the Abaqus output directory and runs:
    - `abaqus j={simulation_name} interactive`

- `00_Main_Scripts/getForceDisp.py`
  - Intended to run under Abaqus CAE `noGUI`.
  - Uses Abaqus modules such as `abaqus`, `abaqusConstants`, and `odbAccess`.
  - Extracts reaction force and displacement from named node sets.

- `00_Main_Scripts/postprocessing_abaqus_sim_v01.py`
  - Calls Abaqus CAE noGUI extraction.
  - Loads generated CSV results.
  - Plots simulation vs ROM, cyclic displacement vs time, and simulation vs experimental data.

## Secondary scripts

- `01_Secondary_Scripts/curvature_ofROM.py`

## Dependencies inferred from imports

Python-side imports include:

- Standard library: `os`, `csv`, `math`, `sys`, `tempfile`, `shutil`, `pathlib`, `itertools`, `re`, `copy`, `xml`
- Scientific/plotting: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`
- GUI: `tkinter`
- Simulation: `microstructpy`
- Abaqus Python runtime only: `abaqus`, `abaqusConstants`, `odbAccess`

On the current Hermes WSL environment:

- `numpy`: available
- `pandas`: missing
- `matplotlib`: missing
- `microstructpy`: missing
- `abaqus`: not detected on PATH

So I could inspect and syntax-check the code, but I could not run the full simulation pipeline here without installing dependencies and having Abaqus available.

## Checks performed

- Safely inspected the zip before extraction.
- Extracted to `/workspace/microstructure_fatigue_simulation`.
- Parsed Python files with `compileall`.
- Result: Python syntax compilation passed for all `.py` files.
- Parsed the Python AST to identify imports and function definitions.
- Read the README and representative XML inputs.

## Initial issues / risks noticed

1. Hardcoded Windows paths

   Several scripts contain paths like:

   - `C:\Users\MAEadmin\Desktop\microstructure fatigue simulation\...`
   - OneDrive paths in older postprocessing script examples.

   This will be fragile for collaborators unless moved to command-line arguments, a config file, or path auto-discovery.

2. `os.system(...)` use

   Abaqus execution currently uses `os.system`, for example:

   - `abaqus j={simulation_name} interactive`
   - `abaqus cae noGUI=..\..\..\00_Main_Scripts\getForceDisp.py`

   This works for quick scripts, but `subprocess.run([...], check=True)` would be safer, more debuggable, and more cross-platform.

3. Windows path separator in Abaqus noGUI call

   `postprocessing_abaqus_sim_v01.py` uses backslashes in:

   - `..\..\..\00_Main_Scripts\getForceDisp.py`

   This is Windows-specific. It should be constructed with `pathlib.Path` or `os.path.join`.

4. Unit-domain assumption

   The postprocessing assumes domain side length = 1, so:

   - stress = force / 1
   - strain = displacement / 1

   This is valid only if the simulation domain and thickness/area assumptions are consistent. If future geometries change, this becomes a scientific correctness risk.

5. Interactive GUI/plot prompts in automation path

   The main generation code can use file dialogs and cyclic pre-visualization prompts. These are useful manually but may block batch or cluster runs.

6. Versioned duplicate scripts

   There are `abaqus_input_generation_v00.py`, `v01.py`, and `v02.py`, plus two postprocessing versions. This is okay for development history, but for thesis reproducibility I would recommend marking one official pipeline and moving old versions to `archive/`.

7. Missing dependency declaration

   No `requirements.txt`, `environment.yml`, or setup instructions were found. This will make reproduction harder.

8. Included `__pycache__` files

   The archive includes Python bytecode caches. These are not needed and should usually be excluded from shared source archives.

## Recommended next improvements

Highest priority:

1. Add `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` for non-Abaqus dependencies.
2. Replace hardcoded input/output paths with CLI arguments or a config file.
3. Replace `os.system` with `subprocess.run` and capture errors.
4. Make path handling cross-platform using `pathlib.Path`.
5. Add a small `run_demo.py` or command example using a known XML input.
6. Create a `.gitignore` excluding `__pycache__/`, Abaqus output files, and generated plots/CSVs if not intended as source data.

For scientific robustness:

1. Make domain dimensions and cross-sectional area explicit in postprocessing.
2. Store simulation metadata next to each output: input XML, git commit/version, mesh parameters, Abaqus settings, and postprocessing assumptions.
3. Add validation checks for XML inputs before running expensive simulations.
4. Add batch-run support for the parameter-sweep folders.

## Bottom line

This is a promising and fairly complete research pipeline, not just a loose script collection. The core idea is clear: XML-driven MicroStructPy microstructure generation, Abaqus simulation, then ROM/experimental comparison. The biggest practical risks are reproducibility and portability: hardcoded Windows paths, missing dependency file, interactive prompts in the main path, and implicit unit-domain stress/strain assumptions.
